    ToDo: Incorporate split logic in pred_perf, historical preds, etc.

	XGBoost:

		1. Predict a split line (initially use label halfway between 2 labels; e.g., .5)
		2. Split into 2 leaves by choosing a random split point in the data.
		3. This will create 2 leaves of 2 sets of data.
		4. Calc similarity score for the set in each leaf:

			residual == prediction - label value
			res = residual

			simX = (res1 + res2 + res3)^2/(num_samples + lambda)

		5. Gain is the Sum of all the similarities minus the root similarity

			Gain = sim1 + sim2 + sim3 - simm_root

		6. Start again with a new decision threshold. Compare the gain.

		7. Default level of splits == 6

		8. Pruning branches. 

			Using gamma variable (default 130), we subtract gamma from gain. If the result is negative, we remove the branch.

		9. When lambda > 0, it is easier to prune leaves because gains are smaller (due to larger divisor)

		10. For each leaf: 
				Cal the output value:
					sum_of_res/(num_res + lambda)

		11. Learning rate is 'eta'

		12. Use the learning rate to calulate the next prediction:

		For each leaf:
			
			Calculate the following
			
				new_prediction = initial_prediction + (eta * output value) 

			Take the new prediction and create a new tree; i.e., go to Step 1 with the new prediction.

    ToDo: BOUGHT 4 DAY: ['SINO', 'WWR', 'CBAT', 'IDEX', 'FUTU', 'RIOT', 'FUV', 'PPSI']

    ToDo: Need to rate 3 and 4 day predictions

Feb 9th, 2021:

    TODO: Added some FIXMEs. Fix the FIXMEs.

    Got these predictions for today: 

    "2021-02-09 process complete: 1 day prediction: ['AXTI', 'AQMS', 'PSNL', 'FLUX', 'KURA', 'TPIC', 'BIDU', 'FREQ']", "2021-02-09 process complete: 3 day prediction: ['OEG']", 
	"2021-02-09 process complete: 4 day prediction: ['SINO', 'WWR', 'CBAT', 'IDEX', 'FUTU', 'RIOT', 'FUV', 'PPSI']"

	2 and 5 day did not work.
